Comic Book File Processor
Overview
The Comic Book File Processor is a web application built with Flask and Vue.js that allows users to upload comic book files (e.g., .cbz, .cbr, .cb7). The application processes these files by converting their formats, compressing images, and adding metadata. Users can customize the processing options via parameters.
